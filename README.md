Title:
Heart Failure Prediction

Overview: 

The Heart Failure Prediction project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on a set of features. The project employs four different classifiers to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions, contributing to early detection and proactive healthcare interventions.

Objectives:

Prediction Accuracy: Develop a robust model using four different classifiers to accurately predict the likelihood of heart failure.
Early Detection: Enable early identification of individuals at risk of heart failure to facilitate timely medical interventions.
Model Comparison: Evaluate the performance of each classifier to identify the most effective algorithm for heart failure prediction.

Requirements:

Data: A comprehensive dataset containing relevant features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical indicators related to heart health.

Python Environment: Utilize a Python environment with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

Machine Learning Classifiers: Implement four classifiers, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression.

Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of each classifier.


Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for model training to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Training: Train four different classifiers using the preprocessed dataset.
        Random Forest
        Support Vector Machine
        K-Nearest Neighbors
        Logistic Regression
        GradientBoostingClassifier

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics on the testing dataset.

Comparison and Selection: Compare the performance of the four classifiers and select the most effective one based on the evaluation metrics.
